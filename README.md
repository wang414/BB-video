# BumbleBee

Please wait a while for all the videos to load.

Letâ€™s first provide a preview of the performance of our general policy. [general](./videos/all.mp4)

## Long Sequences

We first demonstrate the performance on the **LAFAN1** dataset, sourced from the Ubisoft La Forge Animation Dataset ([Harvey et al., 2020](https://github.com/ubisoft/ubisoft-laforge-animation-dataset)) [1].

- Charleston Dance: [Charleston Dance](./videos/LongSequence/Charleston.mp4)

- Boxing: [Boxing](./videos/LongSequence/Boxing.mp4)

- Kung Fu: [KungFu](./videos/LongSequence/KungFu.mp4)
- Merged motion combining Charleston Dance and Boxing: [Merged](./videos/LongSequence/Merged.mp4)

## Motions in AMASS
We present the performance of the policies on the AMASS dataset. For motions that can be completed from the beginning, the left side shows their performance under the initial expert models, and the right side shows their performance under the final general policy. The remaining videos demonstrate the performance of the final policy.
